# Experiments
This repository is used to show the experiments built using [TDM](https://github.com/AnnabelleGillet/TDM), that illustrate different capabilities of the library.

## [Comparison with Spark](https://github.com/AnnabelleGillet/TDM-experiments/tree/master/SparkComparison)
In this experiment, we compare the execution time of TDM operators to those of Spark without the added TDM layer, in order to see if TDM induce an overhead compared to the native execution of Spark.

The result of the experiment shows that TDM does not induce an overhead.
